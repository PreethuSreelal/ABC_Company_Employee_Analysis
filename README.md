# ABC Company Employee Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns, to provide insights about their employees across various teams. The analysis involves preprocessing the data, performing various analysis tasks, and presenting the findings graphically.

## Preprocessing
The "height" column was corrected by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180. Data consistency and integrity were ensured before proceeding with the analysis.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Distribution of Employees Across Each Team:** Determined the distribution of employees and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. **Segregation Based on Positions:** Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
3. **Predominant Age Group:** Identified the predominant age group among employees.
4. **Highest Salary Expenditure:** Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary:** Investigated the correlation between age and salary, and represented it visually.

## Graphical Representations
The analysis includes the following visualizations:
- Bar chart and pie chart for employee distribution across teams.
- Bar chart for employee segregation based on positions.
- Bar chart for age group distribution.
- Stacked bar chart for salary expenditure by team and position.
- Scatter plot with a regression line for correlation between age and salary.

## Insights
The key insights gained from the analysis include:
1. The distribution and percentage split of employees across different teams.
2. The distribution of employees based on positions, highlighting the most and least common roles.
3. The predominant age group among employees, providing demographic insights.
4. The highest salary expenditure by team and position, aiding in budgeting and financial planning.
5. The correlation between age and salary, indicating salary trends based on age.
